### About ###
Spark is a project of mine inspired by the work of jQuery. I plan to make it even simpler to use and even more light weight. With help from other developers who knows, maybe it will become more useful than jQuery one day.

### Functions and examples ###
content(element, content, append)
	Return content of element - s.content('p.someClass');
	Replace content of element - s.content('p.someClass', 'New content');
	Append to content of element - s.content('p.someClass', 'Appended content', true);
