**Spark - A lightweight yet powerful JavaScript library.**

## About
Spark is a project of mine inspired by the work of jQuery. I plan to make it even simpler to use and even more light weight.

It has modular development with a PHP script I wrote which minifys and combines all of the modules into one file. This means that if you need to test certain modules all you have to do is add / remove modules from modules.conf and rebuild.

All functions are explained in the wiki as well as how to make plugins. Here is an example of making an element fade out to 0% opacity over the cource of 1000 miliseconds, one second.

```s.opacity('p.myParagraph', 0, 1000);
